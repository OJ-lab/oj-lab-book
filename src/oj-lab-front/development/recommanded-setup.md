### Install Node.js by NVM

If it's the first time you use NVM,
simply run: `nvm install 18`.

> `18` is the currently the latest big LTS version of Node.js,
> check [Node.js Releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) for more information.

If you have already installed Node.js by NVM,
run `nvm use 18` to enable Node.js 18.

You should also run `nvm alias default 18` if you want to set Node.js 18 as default.
